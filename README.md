# AjayaBT Portfolio

## Description

This is an early version of my portfolio. Currently, the only deployed app is a code refactor which we did in the first week of bootcamp. All the other images/links are placeholders.

It is an ugly page as I was more concerned with the structure at the moment and work will be ongoing regarding the design of the page.


## Installation

This is a webpage, the link to which can be found below:

https://ajayabt.github.io/AjayaBT-Portfolio/

additionally, this is the link to the github repository:

https://github.com/ajayabt/AjayaBT-Portfolio

## Usage

This webpage is designed to illustrate the deployed applications of a developer (me). There is only one link to a webpage which I have had input on as mentioned above.

Links are live to generic webpages, e.g. facebook link will go to facebook, not my facebook profile. 



## Credits

All code is my own (as you can probably tell :D). Thank you to the bootcamp instructors and TAs who have enabled me to get this far!
